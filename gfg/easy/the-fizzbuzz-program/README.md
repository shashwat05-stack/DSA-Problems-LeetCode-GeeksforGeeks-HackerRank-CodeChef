# The FizzBuzz Program

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a number  **n,**  print your answer according to the following conditions:

- If the number is divisible by 3, you print Fizz
- If the number is divisible by 5, you print Buzz
- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, you print FizzBuzz
- In any other case, you print the number itself

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: n = 3
Output: Fizz
Explanation: Here, the number is divisible by 3, so Fizz is printed.
```

```
Input: n = 5
Output: Buzz
Explanation: Here the number is divisible by 5, so Buzz is printed.
```

```
Input: number = 15
Output: FizzBuzz
Explanation: Here, the number 15 is divisible by both 3 and 5, so FizzBuzz is printed.

```

```
Input: number = 7
Output: 7
Explanation: 7 is not divisible by 3 or 5.
```

 **Constraints:**

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();

        // code here
        if(n%3==0 && n%5==0){
            System.out.println("FizzBuzz");
        }
        else if(n%5==0){
            System.out.println("Buzz");
        }
        else if(n%3==0){
            System.out.println("Fizz");
        }
        else{
            System.out.println(n);
        }
    }
}
```
