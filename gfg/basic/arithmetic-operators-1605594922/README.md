## Problem

Given two integer variables  **x**  and  **y**. You need to perform the following operations:

- p = x + y, Addition
- q = x - y, Subtraction
- r = x * y, Multiplication
- s = x / y, Division
- t = x % y, Modulo

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: x = 1, y = 2
Output: 3 -1 2 0 1 
Explanation: The given operations are performed
```

```

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

class GFG {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = sc.nextInt();
        int y = sc.nextInt();

        // code here
        int p = x + y;
        int q = x - y;
        int r = x * y;
        int s = x / y;
        int t = x % y;

        // The below code prints the output
        System.out.println(p + " " + q + " " + r + " " + s + " " + t);
    }
}
```
