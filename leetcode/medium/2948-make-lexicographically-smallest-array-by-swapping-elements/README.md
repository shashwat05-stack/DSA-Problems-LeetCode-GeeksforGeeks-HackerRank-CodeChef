# Make Lexicographically Smallest Array by Swapping Elements

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given a  **0-indexed**  array of  **positive**  integers `nums` and a  **positive**  integer `limit`.

In one operation, you can choose any two indices `i` and `j` and swap `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`  **if**  `|nums[i] - nums[j]| <= limit`.

Return  *the  **lexicographically smallest array**  that can be obtained by performing the operation any number of times*.

An array `a` is lexicographically smaller than an array `b` if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, array `a` has an element that is less than the corresponding element in `b`. For example, the array `[2,10,3]` is lexicographically smaller than the array `[10,2,3]` because they differ at index `0` and `2 < 10`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,5,3,9,8], limit = 2
Output: [1,3,5,8,9]
Explanation: Apply the operation 2 times:
- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. The array becomes [1,3,5,9,8]
- Swap nums[3] with nums[4]. The array becomes [1,3,5,8,9]
We cannot obtain a lexicographically smaller array by applying any more operations.
Note that it may be possible to get the same result by doing different operations.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,7,6,18,2,1], limit = 3
Output: [1,6,7,18,1,2]
Explanation: Apply the operation 3 times:
- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. The array becomes [1,6,7,18,2,1]
- Swap nums[0] with nums[4]. The array becomes [2,6,7,18,1,1]
- Swap nums[0] with nums[5]. The array becomes [1,6,7,18,1,2]
We cannot obtain a lexicographically smaller array by applying any more operations.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,7,28,19,10], limit = 3
Output: [1,7,28,19,10]
Explanation: [1,7,28,19,10] is the lexicographically smallest array we can obtain because we cannot apply the operation on any two indices.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 109
- 1 <= limit <= 109

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] lexicographicallySmallestArray(int[] nums, int limit) {
        int n = nums.length;

        int[][] arr = new int[n][2];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i][0] = nums[i];
            arr[i][1] = i;
        }

        Arrays.sort(arr, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));

        int start = 0;

        while (start < n) {

            int end = start;

            while (end + 1 < n &&
                   arr[end + 1][0] - arr[end][0] <= limit) {
                end++;
            }

            List<Integer> indices = new ArrayList<>();

            for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
                indices.add(arr[i][1]);
            }

            Collections.sort(indices);

            for (int i = 0; i < indices.size(); i++) {
                nums[indices.get(i)] = arr[start + i][0];
            }

            start = end + 1;
        }

        return nums;
    }
}
```
