# Count Nodes Equal to Average of Subtree

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return  *the number of nodes where the value of the node is equal to the  **average**  of the values in its  **subtree***.

 **Note:** 

- The average of n elements is the sum of the n elements divided by n and rounded down to the nearest integer.
- A subtree of root is a tree consisting of root and all of its descendants.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: root = [4,8,5,0,1,null,6]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
For the node with value 4: The average of its subtree is (4 + 8 + 5 + 0 + 1 + 6) / 6 = 24 / 6 = 4.
For the node with value 5: The average of its subtree is (5 + 6) / 2 = 11 / 2 = 5.
For the node with value 0: The average of its subtree is 0 / 1 = 0.
For the node with value 1: The average of its subtree is 1 / 1 = 1.
For the node with value 6: The average of its subtree is 6 / 1 = 6.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: For the node with value 1: The average of its subtree is 1 / 1 = 1.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 1000

    int ans = 0;
    public int averageOfSubtree(TreeNode root) {
        dfs(root);
        return ans;
    }

    public int[] dfs(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return new int[]{0, 0};
        }

        int[] left = dfs(root.left);
        int[] right = dfs(root.right);

        int sum = root.val + left[0] + right[0];
        int count = 1 + left[1] + right[1];

        if (root.val == sum / count) {
            ans++;
        }

        return new int[]{sum, count};
    }
}
