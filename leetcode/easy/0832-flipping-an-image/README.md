# Flipping an Image

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an `n x n` binary matrix `image`, flip the image  **horizontally**, then invert it, and return  *the resulting image*.

To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.

- For example, flipping [1,1,0] horizontally results in [0,1,1].

To invert an image means that each `0` is replaced by `1`, and each `1` is replaced by `0`.

- For example, inverting [0,1,1] results in [1,0,0].

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: image = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]].
Then, invert the image: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: image = [[1,1,0,0],[1,0,0,1],[0,1,1,1],[1,0,1,0]]
Output: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]
Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,1]].
Then invert the image: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- n == image.length
- n == image[i].length
- 1 <= n <= 20
- images[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

            for(int i = 0; i < (image[0].length + 1)/2; i++ ){
                //swap
                int temp = row[i] ^ 1;
                row[i] = row[image[0].length - i - 1] ^ 1;
                row[image[0].length - i - 1] = temp;
            }
        }
        return image;
    }
}
```
