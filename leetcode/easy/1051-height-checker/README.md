# Height Checker

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in  **non-decreasing order**  by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array `expected` where `expected[i]` is the expected height of the `ith` student in line.

You are given an integer array `heights` representing the  **current order**  that the students are standing in. Each `heights[i]` is the height of the `ith` student in line (**0-indexed**).

Return  *the  **number of indices**  where* `heights[i] != expected[i]`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
heights:  [1,1,4,2,1,3]
expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4]
Indices 2, 4, and 5 do not match.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,4]
Output: 5
Explanation:
heights:  [5,1,2,3,4]
expected: [1,2,3,4,5]
All indices do not match.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: heights = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 0
Explanation:
heights:  [1,2,3,4,5]
expected: [1,2,3,4,5]
All indices match.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= heights.length <= 100
- 1 <= heights[i] <= 100

```java
class Solution {
    public int heightChecker(int[] heights) {
        Integer[] res = new Integer[heights.length];

        for(int i = 0; i < heights.length; i++){
            res[i] = heights[i];
        }

        Arrays.sort(res);

        int count = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i< heights.length; i++){
            if(heights[i] != res[i]){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;

    }
}
```
