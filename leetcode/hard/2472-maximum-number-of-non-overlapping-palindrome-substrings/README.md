# Maximum Number of Non-overlapping Palindrome Substrings

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

## Problem

You are given a string `s` and a  **positive**  integer `k`.

Select a set of  **non-overlapping**  substrings from the string `s` that satisfy the following conditions:

- The length of each substring is at least k.
- Each substring is a palindrome.

Return  *the  **maximum**  number of substrings in an optimal selection*.

A  **substring**  is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "abaccdbbd", k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: We can select the substrings underlined in s = "abaccdbbd". Both "aba" and "dbbd" are palindromes and have a length of at least k = 3.
It can be shown that we cannot find a selection with more than two valid substrings.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "adbcda", k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no palindrome substring of length at least 2 in the string.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= k <= s.length <= 2000
- s consists of lowercase English letters.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxPalindromes(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();

        boolean[][] pal = new boolean[n][n];

        for (int len = 1; len <= n; len++) {
            for (int i = 0; i + len - 1 < n; i++) {
                int j = i + len - 1;

                if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j) &&
                    (len <= 2 || pal[i + 1][j - 1])) {
                    pal[i][j] = true;
                }
            }
        }

        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1];

            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (i - j >= k && pal[j][i - 1]) {
                    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n];
    }
}
```
